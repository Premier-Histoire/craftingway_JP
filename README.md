# craftingway [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/0e98f567-e9c7-4cd4-b3a7-c303eea4aca0/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/craftingway/deploys)

[Craftingway](https://craftingway.app/) is a website that simulates the crafting system in FFXIV, similar to tools like [Teamcraft](https://github.com/ffxiv-teamcraft). It also has a [crafting solver](https://github.com/alostsock/crafty) built in that is able to simulate thousands or millions of possible crafting actions in just a few seconds, generating a crafting rotation based on the player's stats. The goal is to provide an accessible way of creating improvised, ad hoc rotations quickly, without needing to follow a guide or tinker with a rotation for longer than necessary.
